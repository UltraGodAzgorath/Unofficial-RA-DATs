Hey Everyone.

These are DATs meant to be used with rom managers such as ClrMamePro and RomVault for RetroAchievement rom collections. All the games that are listed in official DATs, such as No-Intro and Redump, that are RA-linked are in these DATs. 
Any roms that aren’t in any official DATs, such as translations, subsets, hacks, homebrews etc, are named as close to No-intro and Redump naming standards as possible. 
These DATs are meant to be TRUE 1G1R DATs with every single RA-supported linked rom, including all versions, languages and regions, added to them and are all selectable in the “REGIONS” drop-down menu option in ClrMamePro. 
Make sure to tick every single region listed so that you keep 1 rom of each game but just put the regions you want the most on the top of the list for high priority and make sure “1G1R Mode” is selected as well.
 
However, there are some exceptions to what roms are and aren’t in the DATs. I’ve listed them below.

1.	I have excluded all MSU-1 Roms from the SNES DATs because I feel that MSU-1 roms aren’t worth the time and effort to be put in the DATs due to the fact that most MSU games have dozens or even over 100 files that make up each game,
    they can’t be launched in retroarch while zipped so you need to extract them first if you want to play them and they’re MUCH bigger in size than normal SNES roms.
  	Also, the msu files seem to have 0MB size value and blank hash values which may cause issues when scanning and I couldn’t find any official DATs for MSU roms to go on either so I’ve decided to exclude them.
3.	I have excluded ELF files from the PS2 DATs. I’m not sure why ELF files are even linked to any PS2 game as they’re like homebrew executables for the PS2, not ISOs and even the official Redump PS2 DAT doesn’t list them at all.
    They seem kind of redundant but if there’s any good reason to add them to the DATs, please let me know and I’ll look into adding them in a future update.
5.	I have excluded FBNEO roms from the non-arcade DATs as I feel FBNEO roms should be exclusive to the Arcade platform. I don’t think many players even use FBNEO for anything else other than Arcade games anyway so I’ve decided to leave them out.
6.	A few of the DATs don’t have the “1G1R Mode” option available and is greyed out in ClrMamePro because all the games for those platforms only have 1 linked rom each so there was no need to make them 1G1R. You can safely scan in “Normal Set Mode” with them. 

That’s it for now. I’ll add more info if there’s anything further to add. Feel free to send me any DMs/PMs in Discord or LB forums if you have any questions or encounter any problems.
